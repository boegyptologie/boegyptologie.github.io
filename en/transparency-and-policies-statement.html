<p class="has-small-font-size"><strong>Aims and Scope</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">Bibliothèque Ouverte d’Égyptologie (BOE) is a peer-reviewed, open-access scholarly journal devoted to the study of ancient Egypt in all its aspects. It welcomes research articles up to 60,000 characters (including spaces and footnotes) on any topic related to Egyptology. The journal embraces multilingual scholarship: submissions are accepted in Arabic, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish (with other languages considered upon request), reflecting our commitment to broad accessibility. BOE’s target readership includes academics, researchers, students, and enthusiasts in the field of Egyptology and ancient studies worldwide. The journal is published by the independent associative publishing house Bibliothèque Ouverte des Mondes Anciens (BOMA), established in France ("association loi 1901") and dedicated to the open dissemination of knowledge in the ancient world disciplines.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size"><strong>Peer Review Policy</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">All submissions undergo double-blind peer review. Upon submission, manuscripts are first assessed by the editorial team for format, clarity, bibliographic integrity, and thematic relevance. If the article meets these criteria, it is forwarded to two independent reviewers, either members of the scientific committee or external specialists, depending on the required expertise. Neither the authors nor the reviewers know each other’s identities.
  
<p class="has-small-font-size">
  The public posting of the manuscript (see Archiving and Preservation) before the completion of the review process may, however, compromise the double-blind peer review. In such cases, the journal applies the 
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.24318/cope.2019.1.9">COPE Ethical Guidelines for Peer Reviewers</a>, Version 2, September 2017, p. 5 (DOI: 10.24318/cope.2019.1.9): if a reviewer believes they have identified the author, they must inform the journal so that the editorial board can determine whether a risk of conflict of interest or bias is present.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">BOE does not accept author-suggested reviewers. Reviewers are selected based on their scholarly expertise and are expected to provide objective, constructive evaluations. Supplementary materials, if any, are also subject to peer review.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">Authors receive reviewer feedback, possibly with revision requests, and are invited to submit a revised version accordingly. The final decision to accept or reject an article lies with the Editor-in-Chief, based on the recommendations of the reviewers and adherence to the journal’s editorial and ethical standards. BOE does not guarantee acceptance of any submission. The expected time from submission to publication is approximately four months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">All research articles undergo peer review. Editorials are not subject to peer review. Book reviews are moderated by the editorial board but are not peer reviewed. Review reports are not made public.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size"><strong>Open Access Statement</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">BOE is a fully open access journal. All articles are made freely available online immediately upon publication, with no embargo period. Readers do not need to register or pay to access the full texts. BOE does not have a print edition for individual issues; however, an annual print compilation of the year's published articles may be offered for purchase. This printed version is supplementary and does not affect the open access status of the articles. All online content is available under an open license (see below), ensuring free and unrestricted access.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size"><strong>Copyright and Licensing</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">Authors retain the copyright to their work. Unless otherwise indicated, all articles published in BOE are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license. This license permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">By submitting a manuscript to BOE, authors agree to publish their work under the CC BY 4.0 license and certify that they hold the necessary rights to all content (text, images, etc.) in the submission. Authors also guarantee that the article does not infringe any third-party copyright or other rights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">BOE also reserves the right to compile and print a paid print edition of all articles published in a given year, under the same open license (CC BY 4.0). Authors retain their full copyright and publishing this print volume does not restrict their rights. Revenues from sales are used solely to support the journal’s sustainability and do not alter the open access status of the articles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size"><strong>Publication Ethics</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">BOE adheres to the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a> principles. We maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward plagiarism and academic misconduct. All manuscripts may be screened for plagiarism. Multiple submissions and redundant publication are not allowed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">Authors must disclose any conflicts of interest and all funding sources. Authorship must reflect real contributions. Reviewers must recuse themselves in case of conflicts. Reviews are confidential, objective, and constructive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size"><strong>Endogeny</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">BOE is committed to minimising endogeny.<br>Publications authored by members of the editorial or scientific committee must remain exceptional, be subject to the same double-blind peer review process, and must under no circumstances receive preferential treatment. To ensure the scientific independence of the journal, the proportion of articles published by members of these committees must not exceed 25% of the total publications in a given calendar year, with a minimum of five articles per year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size"><strong>Corrections and Retractions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">In case of honest errors or proven misconduct (e.g., plagiarism or data falsification), BOE issues a correction or retraction notice as a separate document on Zenodo, each with its own DOI. While these notices cannot be directly attached to the original Zenodo record, they are cross-referenced by DOI and clearly indicated on the BOE website. As the original article cannot be modified or removed from Zenodo, the BOE website will display a clear notice next to the article to reflect its corrected or retracted status. This approach follows the spirit of COPE’s retraction guidelines and aligns with best practices for open-access repositories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size"><strong>Archiving and Preservation</strong></p>
<p class="has-small-font-size">
  The journal ensures the long-term preservation of its publications through Zenodo, an open-access institutional repository managed by CERN and supported by the European Union. Each article is deposited there in its final version and assigned a DOI, guaranteeing stable and lasting accessibility. Authors are free to deposit any version of their article (preprint, accepted manuscript, final published version) in open repositories (Zenodo, HAL, institutional repository, OSF, etc.) without embargo. All deposits must be made under the 
  <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> license and, where applicable, include a link to the final published version of record identified by its DOI.
</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">
  A public deposit of the manuscript before the completion of the review process may, however, compromise the double-blind peer review. In such cases, the journal applies the 
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.24318/cope.2019.1.9">COPE Ethical Guidelines for Peer Reviewers</a>, Version 2, September 2017, p. 5 (DOI: 10.24318/cope.2019.1.9): if a reviewer believes they have identified the author, they must inform the journal so that the editorial board can determine whether a risk of conflict of interest or bias is present.
</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">
  Depositing articles on commercial platforms (such as Academia.edu or ResearchGate) is discouraged, as they do not guarantee long-term preservation, the assignment of stable identifiers, or compliance with licenses.
</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size"><strong>Author Fees</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">There are no submission or publication fees for authors. BOE is entirely free for both authors and readers. No fast-track fees or pay-to-publish options are offered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size"><strong>Revenue Model</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">BOE does not display advertisements or accept sponsorships. Its revenue streams include the optional printed annual volume, which is sold at cost to help cover basic operational expenses, as well as support from the publishing house BOMA and its associated resources.</p>
