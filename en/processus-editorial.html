<p class="has-small-font-size">The journal follows a double-blind peer review process:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">1. The author submits an anonymised article to the editorial board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">2. The editorial board conducts an initial formal and scientific assessment of the article, reviewing overall presentation, coherence of references, clarity of writing, and alignment with the journal’s thematic scope. If the article is deemed admissible, it is forwarded for double-blind peer review to two independent reviewers, either from the scientific committee or external specialists, depending on the required expertise.<br>Neither the authors nor the reviewers know each other’s identities. BOE does not accept author-suggested reviewers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">3. Reviewers are selected based on their scholarly expertise and are expected to provide objective, constructive feedback. Following review, the author receives this feedback, possibly with revision requests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">4. The author implements the requested changes and submits the revised version.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">5. Once the article is accepted, the author is invited to prepare its upload on Zenodo, a free open-access archiving platform, and to reserve a DOI, which is also free. The editorial board provides guidance for this step. The DOI must then be communicated to the journal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">6. The editorial board assigns an article number, pagination, inserts the DOI, and adds the journal’s cover page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">7. The author uploads the final version to Zenodo and informs the editorial board, which then lists the article on the journal’s website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">The Editor-in-Chief (fr: "directeur de la publication" = legal representative) is responsible for the final decision, based on the reviewers’ recommendations and adherence to the journal’s editorial and ethical standards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">All research articles undergo peer review. Editorials are not subject to peer review. Book reviews are moderated by the editorial board but are not peer reviewed. Review reports are not made public. Supplementary materials, if any, are also subject to peer review.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size">The expected time from submission to publication is approximately four months.</p>
